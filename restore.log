[1;33mWarning!!! "range" option is found in dhcpd.conf, this is not a good way to operate Clonezilla... It is better to let your DRBL client acquire same IP address by setting MAC address in dhcpd.conf so that you will NOT overwrite the OS of some unknown machines.
[0;39mFinding the multicast seed ethernet port... done.
Will use ethernet port eth1 for multicast seed in this clonezilla server.
[1;33mYou are using multicast Clonezilla, please make sure:
1. This ethernet port in server is up and connected: eth1 
2. If you have more than one (>=2) network switches for the DRBL environment, make sure all the switches are connected to each other, otherwise the multicast packets will not be sent to every clients from the ethernet port mentioned above via all the switches, so the multicast clone might NOT start.

Setting the PXE clients to DRBL mode with label "Clonezilla: multicast restore DELL_BIG_CLEAN to disk sda"...
Turn off all MENU DEFAULT in /tftpboot/nbi_img/pxelinux.cfg/default... 
Make "clonezilla" as default label in /tftpboot/nbi_img/pxelinux.cfg/default.
The MENU LABEL is "Clonezilla: multicast restore DELL_BIG_CLEAN to disk sda"
Client jobs are recoreded in this file: '/var/log/clonezilla/clonezilla-jobs.log',
The sfdisk log when running clonezilla is in client /var/log/clonezilla-restore-sfdisk.log

[1;33mNow set the client machines to boot from PXE or Etherboot (refer to http://drbl.sourceforge.net for more details). Then boot those clients, so that the template image can be cloned to them!
NOTE! (1) If Etherboot is used on client computers, version 5.4.0 or newer is required! (2) If the cloned OS is MS windows, and it fails to boot with an error message like "Missing Operating System" or "Invalid System Disk", then you can try to (1) change the IDE hard drive settings in the BIOS to use LBA mode instead of AUTO mode. (2) Or you can try to use parameter -t1 when restoring.
