[1;33mWarning!!! "range" option is found in dhcpd.conf, this is not a good way to operate Clonezilla... It is better to let your DRBL client acquire same IP address by setting MAC address in dhcpd.conf so that you will NOT overwrite the OS of some unknown machines.

[1;33mNow set up the client machines to boot from PXE or Etherboot (refer to http://drbl.sourceforge.net for more details). Then boot the client to make the template image! Note: If the partition you want to save is a NTFS filesystem, it is recommended to defrag that partition first.
NOTE! (1) If Etherboot is used on client computers, version 5.4.0 or newer is required! (2) If the cloned OS is MS windows, and it fails to boot with an error message like "Missing Operating System" or "Invalid System Disk", then you can try to (1) change the IDE hard drive settings in the BIOS to use LBA mode instead of AUTO mode. (2) Or you can try to use parameter -t1 when restoring.
